	SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.

Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.</h2>
